## Tasks
Create a static page that will display a list of movies found in the JSON file in the repo.
* Display each movie along with picture, and other relevant data.
  * Display the titles from newest to oldest
* Create a React component to display each title
* Style the components as needed (very, very basic - please donâ€™t spend too long on this)
* Create a javascript server to display the application on a localhost
  * Use any server implementation you wish

## Bonus Tasks
These are just additional bonuses, not necessary but good to have working knowledge with.
* Add functionality to like or dislike each movie
  * Do this using redux and store it in the state
* Store the JSON in a MongoDB
  * Call to the DB to display the data in the application
